		<h2><strong>M</strong>onitoring <strong>O</strong>bservations <strong>O</strong>f  <strong>S</strong>MC X-1's <strong>E</strong>xcursions - Collaboration Overview & Goals</h2>
		<p> MOOSE is a monitoring program designed to study the soft X-ray fluctuations of SMC X-1 as it undergoes super-orbital period variability. SMC X-1 has previously been observed to undergo three epochs of super-orbital period variability, yet these properties have never been probed during those epochs. The fourth observed epoch began in 2020-2021, and is subsequently being monitored by NICER. <p>
		<p> The physical mechanism for SMC X-1's superorbital periodicities is currently unclear; X-ray monitoring by MOOSE will help shed light on the nature of the source as the superorbital period varies. </p> 
		
		
		<h2>Background and Scientific Context</h2>

SMC X-1 is an accreting neutron star Be (this is the classification of its donor star) X-ray binary, and a pulsar. Accretion is where the neutron star pulls matter from a nearby “donor” star that it is in a binary with (see also the below figure). The particles in the accretion disk lose energy due to viscous friction and fall to the centre, onto the compact object (in this case, neutron star) where they release energy in X-rays. Because neutron stars are highly magnetized at the poles, it releases radiation in beams. The neutron star is also spinning really fast, so it has the same effect as looking at a lighthouse.


 SMC X-1 is an unusual system because we have information about its pulse period (0.7 seconds, or how fast is spins), binary orbital period (3.89 days for the neutron star and donor star to orbit each other), as well as a mysterious “super orbital” period, which ranges from 40-60 days. Unlike other systems with super orbital periods, this source undergoes excursions, or superorbital modulations, where it will drop from 60 days to near 40 over about 3 years. There are a few different arguments about why this happens, but the thought is that it’s something to do with the shape of the disc changing. We are going to investigate this with NICER using methods from X-ray spectroscopy.
