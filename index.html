		<p>  <img src="MOOSE.png" align="right" alt="MOOSE logo" style="width:30%">
		MOOSE is a monitoring program designed to study the soft X-ray fluctuations of SMC X-1 as it undergoes super-orbital period variability (thought to signal a change in the disc geometry). SMC X-1 has previously been observed to undergo at least three epochs of super-orbital period variability, yet properties of the accretion disc physics and shape have never been probed during those epochs. The fourth observed epoch began in 2020-2021, and is currently being monitored by NICER, an X-ray telescope mounted on the International Space Station. 
		
		 <p>
		<p> The physical mechanism behind SMC X-1's superorbital periodicities/changes in accretion disc shape is currently unclear; X-ray monitoring by MOOSE will help shed light on the nature of the source as the superorbital period varies. </p> 

		<h2>Background and Scientific Context</h2>

SMC X-1 is an accreting neutron star X-ray binary, and a pulsar. Accretion happens when the neutron star pulls matter from a nearby “donor” star that it is in a binary with (see also the below figure). The particles in the accretion disk lose energy due to viscous friction and fall to the centre, onto the compact object (in this case, neutron star) where they release energy in X-rays. In addition to releasing X-ray radiation from the accretion disc, we also see X-ray pulses from the neutron star. Because neutron stars are highly magnetized at the poles, it also collects matter onto the poles, which releases radiation in beams. The neutron star is also spinning at a rate of ~0.7 seconds, so when we see the beamed radiation from the poles, it has the same effect as looking at a lighthouse.

<p>
<p>
 SMC X-1 is an unusual system because we have information about its pulse period, binary orbital period (3.89 days for the neutron star and donor star to orbit each other), as well the mysterious “super-orbital” period, our observational proxy for the warp of the accretion disc, which ranges from 40-60 days. Unlike other systems with super-orbital periods, this source undergoes excursions, where the periodic signal will drop from 60 days to near 40 over about 3 years. There are a few different arguments about why this happens, but one of the leading explanations is radiation driven warping, where the beam from the pulsar irradiates the accretion disc, causing it to change shape. Although compelling from a theoretical standpoint, this mechanism has never been definitively linked via observations, which the MOOSE data-set is designed to probe.
